# Cat Fact Powershell

## This script will run get a random cat fact from https://catfact.ninja/fact and will run it through the windows speech synthesizer to read it aloud.

This code is just for fun. Unfortunately is is also poorly documented. The script is small and fairly self explanitory.

I hope to get Watson's speech api integrated into this as it makes the speech output much smoother.
